# Tic Tac Toe with AI Opposition

This application was programmed with Python. If you have not installed Python, install it [here](https://python.org/downloads). Make sure that you have also installed `pip`

This application uses `numpy` and `pygame`. If you do not have any of the two installed, write this command in your terminal emulator:

- If you are on Windows, <br />
` $ pip install -r requirements.txt`

- If you are on Mac/Linux, <br />
` $ sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`

Once you have both packages installed, go to the directory where the application is installed, and run `python game.py`.
